<h1>Basic OTT Platform UI Project</h1>

This is a basic front-end project related to an OTT (Over-The-Top) platform, built using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. The project focuses on creating a clean and responsive user interface that mimics the layout of modern streaming platforms, including sections for featured content, categories, and navigation. It's a great example of using Tailwind CSS for fast and efficient UI development.
